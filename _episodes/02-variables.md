## Use variables to store values.

*   Variables are names for values.
*   In Python the `=` symbol assigns the value on the right to the name on the left.
*   The variable is created when a value is assigned to it.
*   Here, Python assigns an age to a variable `age`
    and a name in quotation marks to a variable `first_name`.

~~~
roi_vol = 130
roi_label = 'hippocampus'
~~~
{: .python}

*   Variable names:
    *   cannot start with a digit
    *   cannot contain spaces, quotation marks, or other punctuation
    *   *may* contain an underscore (typically used to separate words in long variable names)
*   Underscores at the start like `__roi_vol` have a special meaning
    so we won't do that until we understand the convention.

## Use `print` to display values.

*   Python has a built-in function called `print` that prints things as text.
*   Call the function (i.e., tell Python to run it) by using its name.
*   Provide values to the function (i.e., the things to print) in parentheses.
*   The values passed to the function are called 'arguments'

~~~
print('The', roi_label , 'is', roi_vol, 'cubic mm')
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
The hippocampus is 130 cubic mm
~~~
{: .output}

*   `print` automatically puts a single space between items to separate them.
*   And wraps around to a new line at the end.

## Variables must be created before they are used.

*   If a variable doesn't exist yet, or if the name has been mis-spelled,
    Python reports an error.
    *   Unlike some languages, which "guess" a default value.

~~~
print(brain_volume)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-1-c1fbb4e96102> in <module>()
----> 1 print(brain_volume)

NameError: name 'brain_volume' is not defined
~~~
{: .error}

*   The last line of an error message is usually the most informative.
<!-- *   We will look at error messages in detail [later]({{ page.root }}/05-error-messages/). -->

## Variables can be used in calculations.

*   We can use variables in calculations just as if they were values.
    *   Remember, we assigned 130 to `roi_vol` a few lines ago.

~~~
corrected_roi_vol = roi_vol + 3
print('Volume with a correction for a systematic bias:', corrected_roi_vol)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Volume with a correction for a systematic bias: 133
~~~
{: .output}

## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

*   Sometimes called a "subscript".
*   Each character in a string is in a particular location.
*   Use the location's index in square brackets to get the character.
*   Locations are numbered from 0 rather than 1.

~~~
roi_label = 'hippocampus'
print(roi_label[0])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
h
~~~
{: .output}

## Use a slice to get a substring.

*   A slice extracts elements, based on a start and stop value
*   A slice consists of `[start:stop]`.
*   From the start value (inclusive) up to but not including the stop value (exclusive).
*   So the difference between stop and start is the slice's length.

~~~
print(roi_label[0:5])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
hippo
~~~
{: .output}

## A slice with a different step
* We don't have to take every element in the range we specify. We can specify
the step  by which we take elements from the string.

~~~
print(roi_label[0:5:2])
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
hpo
~~~
{: .output}


## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

~~~
print(len(roi_label))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
11
~~~
{: .output}

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
    just like in mathematics.



## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names
    so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')
flabadab = 700
ewr_422_yY = 'frontal cortex'
print('The',ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'cubic mm')
~~~
{: .python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

## Variables exist in the IPython environment
We can list the variables we have defined, along with some details about them,
by executing the IPython magic `%whos`:
~~~
%whos
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Variable            Type    Data/Info
-------------------------------------
corrected_roi_vol   int     133
ewr_422_yY          str     frontal cortex
flabadab            int     700
roi_label           str     hippocampus
roi_vol             int     130
~~~
{: .output}

These variables do not exist on the hard disk of the computer. They will not
continue to exist if we stop our current IPython kernel (by executing `exit`).
Ideally, in any time in our analysis we should be able to remove these variables
and regenerate them  again by running a script file containing all  of the
commands we used to get to our current state. Later on we will learn the tools
that IPython provides to do this. For now we will simply learn how to delete all
of the variables in the current environment. This is done using the `%reset`
IPython magic and typing `y` and enter to confirm:
~~~
%reset
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])? 
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
